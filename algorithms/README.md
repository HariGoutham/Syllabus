## ðŸ“‹ Common Algorithms

### 1. **Sorting Algorithms**
- **Description**: Algorithms that arrange the elements of a list or array in a specific order (ascending or descending).
- **Common Types**:
  - **Bubble Sort**: Simple comparison-based sorting algorithm.
  - **Selection Sort**: Repeatedly selects the smallest (or largest) element and moves it to the sorted portion.
  - **Insertion Sort**: Builds a sorted array one element at a time.
  - **Merge Sort**: A divide-and-conquer algorithm that splits the array into halves, sorts them, and merges them back.
  - **Quick Sort**: A divide-and-conquer algorithm that selects a 'pivot' and partitions the array around it.
  - **Heap Sort**: Utilizes a binary heap data structure to sort elements.

### 2. **Searching Algorithms**
- **Description**: Algorithms that retrieve information stored within some data structure.
- **Common Types**:
  - **Linear Search**: Sequentially checks each element until the desired element is found.
  - **Binary Search**: Efficiently finds an element in a sorted array by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half.

### 3. **Dynamic Programming (DP)**
- **Description**: A method for solving complex problems by breaking them down into simpler subproblems and storing the results to avoid redundant calculations.
- **Common Techniques**:
  - **Top-Down (Memoization)**: Recursively solves subproblems and stores their results.
  - **Bottom-Up (Tabulation)**: Iteratively builds up solutions to subproblems and stores them in a table.
- **Use Cases**: Fibonacci sequence, knapsack problem, longest common subsequence.

### 4. **Backtracking**
- **Description**: A general algorithm for finding all (or some) solutions to computational problems, particularly constraint satisfaction problems.
- **Use Cases**: N-Queens problem, Sudoku solver, permutations and combinations.

### 5. **Greedy Algorithms**
- **Description**: Algorithms that make the locally optimal choice at each stage with the hope of finding a global optimum.
- **Use Cases**: Activity selection problem, Huffman coding, minimum spanning tree (Kruskal's and Prim's algorithms).

### 6. **Graph Algorithms**
- **Description**: Algorithms that operate on graph data structures to solve problems related to graph traversal, shortest paths, and connectivity.
- **Common Types**:
  - **Depth-First Search (DFS)**: Explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.
  - **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**: Explores all neighbors at the present depth prior to moving on to nodes at the next depth level.
  - **Dijkstra's Algorithm**: Finds the shortest path from a source node to all other nodes in a weighted graph.
  - **Bellman-Ford Algorithm**: Computes shortest paths from a single source vertex to all other vertices in a graph.
  - **Floyd-Warshall Algorithm**: Finds shortest paths between all pairs of vertices.

### 7. **Divide and Conquer**
- **Description**: An algorithm design paradigm that works by recursively breaking down a problem into two or more sub-problems of the same or related type until these become simple enough to be solved directly.
- **Use Cases**: Merge sort, quick sort, binary search.

### 8. **Bit Manipulation**
- **Description**: Techniques that involve the manipulation of individual bits of data, often used for optimization.
- **Common Operations**:
  - Bitwise AND, OR, XOR, NOT
  - Left shift and right shift
- **Use Cases**: Finding unique numbers, counting bits, swapping numbers.

### 9. **Mathematical Algorithms**
- **Description**: Algorithms that solve problems using mathematical concepts.
- **Common Types**:
  - **Greatest Common Divisor (GCD)**: Euclidean algorithm for finding the GCD of two numbers.
  - **Sieve of Eratosthenes**: Efficient algorithm for finding all prime numbers up to a specified integer.
  - **Combinatorics**: Permutations and combinations calculations.

### 10. **String Algorithms**
- **Description**: Algorithms that deal with the manipulation and analysis of strings.
- **Common Types**:
  - **KMP Algorithm**: Efficient string matching algorithm - **Rabin-Karp Algorithm**: Uses hashing to find any one of a set of pattern strings in a text.
  - **Longest Common Substring**: Finds the longest substring present in two or more strings.
  - **Trie**: A tree-like data structure that stores a dynamic set of strings, useful for prefix searching.
