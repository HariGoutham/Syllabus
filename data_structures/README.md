# ðŸ“Š Data Structures for LeetCode and HackerRank

Welcome to the **Data Structures** repository! This guide provides an overview of common data structures that are frequently encountered in coding challenges on platforms like LeetCode and HackerRank. Understanding these data structures is crucial for solving problems efficiently. Let's explore them! ðŸŒŸ

## ðŸ“‹ Common Data Structures

### 1. **Array**
- **Description**: A collection of elements identified by index or key. Arrays are used to store multiple items of the same type together.
- **Use Cases**: Storing a list of items, implementing other data structures like stacks and queues.

### 2. **Linked List**
- **Description**: A linear data structure where elements are stored in nodes, each containing a reference (or link) to the next node in the sequence.
- **Types**:
  - **Singly Linked List**: Each node points to the next node.
  - **Doubly Linked List**: Each node points to both the next and previous nodes.
- **Use Cases**: Dynamic memory allocation, implementing stacks and queues.

### 3. **Stack**
- **Description**: A collection of elements that follows the Last In First Out (LIFO) principle. Elements can be added and removed from the top of the stack.
- **Use Cases**: Function call management, expression evaluation, backtracking algorithms.

### 4. **Queue**
- **Description**: A collection of elements that follows the First In First Out (FIFO) principle. Elements are added at the back and removed from the front.
- **Types**:
  - **Simple Queue**: Basic FIFO structure.
  - **Circular Queue**: Connects the end of the queue back to the front.
  - **Priority Queue**: Elements are removed based on priority rather than order.
- **Use Cases**: Task scheduling, breadth-first search (BFS) in graphs.

### 5. **Hash Table**
- **Description**: A data structure that implements an associative array, a structure that can map keys to values. It uses a hash function to compute an index into an array of buckets or slots.
- **Use Cases**: Fast data retrieval, counting occurrences, implementing sets.

### 6. **Tree**
- **Description**: A hierarchical data structure consisting of nodes, where each node has a value and references to child nodes. The top node is called the root.
- **Types**:
  - **Binary Tree**: Each node has at most two children.
  - **Binary Search Tree (BST)**: A binary tree where the left child is less than the parent and the right child is greater.
  - **Balanced Trees**: Such as AVL trees and Red-Black trees, which maintain balance for efficient operations.
- **Use Cases**: Hierarchical data representation, searching and sorting.

### 7. **Graph**
- **Description**: A collection of nodes (vertices) and edges connecting pairs of nodes. Graphs can be directed or undirected.
- **Types**:
  - **Weighted Graph**: Edges have weights (costs).
  - **Unweighted Graph**: All edges are equal.
- **Use Cases**: Network routing, social networks, pathfinding algorithms.

### 8. **Heap**
- **Description**: A special tree-based data structure that satisfies the heap property. In a max heap, for any given node, the value of the node is greater than or equal to the values of its children. In a min heap, the value is less than or equal to its children.
- **Use Cases**: Priority queues, sorting algorithms (Heap Sort).

### 9. **Trie (Prefix Tree)**
- **Description**: A tree-like data structure that stores a dynamic set of strings, where the keys are usually strings. Each node represents a common prefix of some strings.
- **Use Cases**: Autocomplete features, spell checking.

### 10. **Disjoint Set (Union-Find)**
- **Description**: A data structure that keeps track of a partition of a set into disjoint (non-overlapping) subsets. It supports union and find operations.
- **Use Cases**: Network connectivity, Kruskal's algorithm for minimum spanning trees.
