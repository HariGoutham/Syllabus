# Angular Interview Preparation Guide

This guide provides a concise overview of core Angular concepts and practical skills to help you prepare for interviews and enhance your understanding of Angular development.

## Core Angular Concepts

### Components
- **Understanding components and their lifecycle**: Familiarize yourself with lifecycle hooks like `ngOnInit` and `ngOnDestroy`.
- **Creating and using custom components**: Learn how to build reusable components.
- **Component inputs and outputs**: Use `@Input()` and `@Output()` with `EventEmitter` for data communication.
- **Two-way data binding**: Implement two-way data binding using `[(ngModel)]`.
- **Content projection**: Utilize `<ng-content>` for content projection in components.

### Modules
- **Understanding Angular modules (NgModule)**: Learn the purpose and structure of modules in Angular.
- **Creating and using shared modules**: Build shared modules for reusable components and services.
- **Bootstrapping applications with modules**: Understand how to bootstrap an Angular application.

### Services and Dependency Injection
- **Creating and using services**: Implement services for business logic and data management.
- **Understanding Angular's dependency injection mechanism**: Learn how Angular manages service instances.
- **Using services for cross-component communication**: Facilitate communication between components using services.

### Routing
- **Setting up routing and navigation**: Configure routing for navigation between views.
- **Dynamic routes and route parameters**: Handle dynamic routes and extract parameters.
- **Route guards and lazy loading**: Implement route guards for access control and lazy loading for performance optimization.

### Forms
- **Template-driven vs. reactive forms**: Understand the differences and use cases for each form approach.
- **Form validation and custom validators**: Implement validation logic for user input.
- **Handling form submissions**: Manage form submissions effectively.

### Directives
- **Understanding built-in directives**: Learn about directives like `ngIf`, `ngFor`, and `ngModel`.
- **Creating custom directives**: Build your own directives to extend HTML behavior.

### Pipes
- **Using built-in pipes and creating custom pipes**: Transform data using pipes.
- **Understanding pure and impure pipes**: Learn the differences and use cases for each type of pipe.

### State Management
- **Managing component state and data flow**: Understand how to manage state within components.
- **Understanding change detection strategies (OnPush)**: Optimize performance with change detection strategies.

### HTTP Client
- **Making HTTP requests (GET, POST)**: Use Angular's HttpClient to interact with APIs.
- **Handling HTTP responses and errors**: Manage responses and errors effectively.
- **Using interceptors for request/response manipulation**: Implement interceptors for modifying requests and responses.

### Observables and RxJS
- **Understanding observables and how to use them**: Learn the basics of observables in Angular.
- **Working with RxJS operators**: Utilize RxJS operators for reactive programming.
- **Converting between signals and observables**: Understand how to work with both signals and observables.

## Practical Skills
- **Setting Up a Project**: Familiarize yourself with Angular CLI commands for creating and managing projects.
- **Component Communication**: Practice passing data between parent and child components using inputs and outputs.
- **Form Handling**: Build a simple form with validation to understand how to manage user input.
- **Routing**: Create a basic routing setup with multiple routes and navigation links.
- **Service Creation**: Implement a service to fetch data from an API and use it in a component.
- **Debugging**: Learn to use Angular DevTools and browser DevTools for debugging.

## Interview Preparation Tips
- **Understand Key Concepts**: Be prepared to explain the purpose of components, services, modules, and routing in Angular.
- **Hands-On Practice**: Build a small project that incorporates components, services, routing, and forms to solidify your understanding.
- **Common Questions**: Prepare for common interview questions about Angular's architecture, lifecycle hooks, and state management.
- **Stay Updated**: Familiarize yourself with the latest features in Angular, such as signals and the latest changes in dependency injection.

By focusing on these major topics and practical skills, you should be well-prepared for your upcoming interviews. Good luck!
