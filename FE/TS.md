# TypeScript Interview Preparation Guide

This guide provides a concise overview of core TypeScript concepts and practical skills to help you prepare for interviews and enhance your understanding of TypeScript development.

## Core TypeScript Concepts

### 1. Introduction to TypeScript
- **Course Setup**: Setting up your development environment for TypeScript.
- **Using Types**: Understanding the importance of types in TypeScript.
- **TypeScript Types vs JavaScript Types**: Differences between TypeScript and JavaScript types.

### 2. Basic Types
- **Working with Numbers, Strings & Booleans**: Basic data types in TypeScript.
- **Type Assignment & Type Inference**: How TypeScript infers types.
- **Object Types**: Defining and using object types.
- **Arrays and Tuples**: Working with array types and tuples.
- **Enums**: Using enumerated types for better code readability.

### 3. Advanced Types
- **Union Types**: Defining variables that can hold multiple types.
- **Literal Types**: Using specific string or number values as types.
- **Type Aliases / Custom Types**: Creating custom types for better code organization.
- **Function Return Types & "void"**: Specifying return types for functions.

### 4. Functions
- **Functions as Types**: Understanding how functions can be treated as types.
- **Function Types & Callbacks**: Defining function types and using callbacks.
- **The "unknown" and "never" Types**: Understanding these special types in TypeScript.

### 5. Classes and Interfaces
- **What are Classes?**: Introduction to classes in TypeScript.
- **Creating Classes**: Defining and using classes.
- **Inheritance**: Extending classes and using inheritance.
- **Interfaces**: Defining contracts for classes and objects.
- **Using Interfaces with Classes**: Implementing interfaces in class definitions.

### 6. Generics
- **Built-in Generics**: Understanding and using built-in generic types.
- **Creating Generic Functions**: Writing functions that can work with any data type.
- **Generic Classes**: Defining classes that can operate on different types.

### 7. Decorators
- **What are Decorators?**: Introduction to decorators in TypeScript.
- **Creating Decorators**: Building and using decorators for classes and methods.
- **Validation with Decorators**: Implementing validation logic using decorators.

### 8. Advanced TypeScript Features
- **Intersection Types**: Combining multiple types into one.
- **Type Guards**: Narrowing down types using type guards.
- **Discriminated Unions**: Using union types with a common property for type checking.
- **Type Casting**: Converting one type to another.

### 9. Working with Modules
- **Using ES Modules**: Importing and exporting modules in TypeScript.
- **Namespaces**: Organizing code with namespaces.

### 10. Tooling and Configuration
- **Using Webpack**: Setting up Webpack for TypeScript projects.
- **Using JavaScript Libraries with TypeScript**: Integrating third-party libraries.
- **Setting Up a React + TypeScript Project**: Combining React with TypeScript.

## Practical Skills
- **Setting Up Your Environment**: Configure your code editor (e.g., VS Code) for TypeScript development.
- **Building Small Projects**: Create small projects to apply your TypeScript knowledge.
- **Debugging**: Use debugging tools in your IDE to troubleshoot TypeScript code.
- **Engaging in Challenges**: Participate in coding challenges to reinforce your learning and problem-solving skills.

## Interview Preparation Tips
- **Understand Key Concepts**: Be prepared to explain TypeScript fundamentals, classes, interfaces, and generics.
- **Hands-On Practice**: Build small projects that incorporate the concepts learned.
- **Common Questions**: Prepare for questions about TypeScript features, type safety, and OOP principles.
- **Stay Updated**: Familiarize yourself with the latest trends and tools in TypeScript development.

By focusing on these major topics and practical skills, you should be well-prepared for your upcoming interviews or practical applications in TypeScript development. Good luck!

Enhancements to Consider
While your guide is sufficient for most interviews, consider adding the following:

TypeScript Utility Types: Topics like Partial, Required, Readonly, Record, Pick, and Omit are frequently used in real-world scenarios and interviews.
Mapped Types: Understanding how to create and use mapped types for advanced type transformations.
Conditional Types: Using conditional logic within types for dynamic type resolution.
Module Resolution Strategies: Insights into how TypeScript resolves modules, including paths and baseUrl configuration.
Integration with Frameworks: A deeper dive into using TypeScript with popular frameworks/libraries like Angular or Node.js.
Performance and Optimization: Topics like how TypeScript compilation affects large projects, and best practices for improving performance.
