# üìê Design Patterns in Software Development

Welcome to the **Design Patterns** repository! This guide provides an overview of common design patterns used in software development. Understanding these patterns can help you write more maintainable, scalable, and efficient code. Let's explore the different categories of design patterns! üåü

## üèóÔ∏è Creational Patterns

Creational patterns deal with object creation mechanisms, trying to create objects in a manner suitable to the situation.

1. **Singleton Pattern**
   - Ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it.

2. **Factory Method Pattern**
   - Defines an interface for creating an object but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created.

3. **Abstract Factory Pattern**
   - Provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.

4. **Builder Pattern**
   - Separates the construction of a complex object from its representation, allowing the same construction process to create different representations.

5. **Prototype Pattern**
   - Creates new objects by copying an existing object, known as the prototype.

6. **Object Pool Pattern**
   - Manages a pool of reusable objects to minimize the overhead of object creation and destruction.

7. **Simple Factory Pattern**
   - A simple way to create objects without exposing the instantiation logic to the client.

## üèóÔ∏è Structural Patterns

Structural patterns deal with object composition, creating relationships between objects to form larger structures.

1. **Adapter Pattern**
   - Allows incompatible interfaces to work together by converting the interface of a class into another interface that clients expect.

2. **Bridge Pattern**
   - Separates an object‚Äôs interface from its implementation, allowing the two to vary independently.

3. **Composite Pattern**
   - Composes objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies, allowing clients to treat individual objects and compositions uniformly.

4. **Decorator Pattern**
   - Adds new functionality to an object dynamically without altering its structure.

5. **Facade Pattern**
   - Provides a simplified interface to a complex subsystem, making it easier to use.

6. **Flyweight Pattern**
   - Reduces the cost of creating and manipulating a large number of similar objects by sharing common parts.

7. **Proxy Pattern**
   - Provides a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access to it.

## üß† Behavioral Patterns

Behavioral patterns deal with object interaction and responsibility, defining how objects communicate and collaborate.

1. **Chain of Responsibility Pattern**
   - Passes a request along a chain of handlers, allowing multiple objects to handle the request without the sender needing to know which object will handle it.

2. **Command Pattern**
   - Encapsulates a request as an object, allowing for parameterization of clients with queues, requests, and operations.

3. **Interpreter Pattern**
   - Defines a representation for a language's grammar and provides an interpreter to deal with the grammar.

4. **Iterator Pattern**
   - Provides a way to access the elements of an aggregate object sequentially without exposing its underlying representation.

5. **Mediator Pattern**
   - Defines an object that encapsulates how a set of objects interact, promoting loose coupling.

6. **Memento Pattern**
   - Captures and externalizes an object's internal state without violating encapsulation, allowing the object to be restored to this state later.

7. **Null Object Pattern**
   - Uses a special object with a neutral behavior to avoid null references.

8. **Observer Pattern**
   - Defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically.

9. **State Pattern**
   - Allows an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes, appearing to change its class.

10. **Strategy Pattern**
    - Defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable, allowing the algorithm to vary independently from clients that use it.

11. **Template Method Pattern**
    - Defines the skeleton of an algorithm in a method, deferring some steps to subclasses.

12. **Visitor Pattern**
    - Represents an operation to be performed on the elements of an object structure, allowing you to define new operations without changing the classes of the elements.

## üìè SOLID Principles

The SOLID principles are a set of design principles intended to make software designs more understandable, flexible, and maintainable.

1. **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**
   - A class should have one and only one reason to change, meaning it should have only one job.

2. **Open/Closed Principle (OCP)**
   - Software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification.

3. **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)**
   - Objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of a subclass without affecting the correctness of the program.

4. **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)**
   - Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use. Instead, multiple specific interfaces are better than a single general-purpose interface.

5. **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)**
   - High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions, and abstractions should not depend on details.
