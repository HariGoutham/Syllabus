## üèóÔ∏è Creational Patterns

Creational patterns deal with object creation mechanisms, trying to create objects in a manner suitable to the situation. Think of these patterns as different ways to build a house, depending on the materials and design you want.

1. **Singleton Pattern**
   - **Analogy**: A president of a country‚Äîthere can only be one at a time.
   - **Use Case**: Database connections, logging, or configuration settings.
   - [Learn More](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/singleton)

2. **Factory Method Pattern**
   - **Analogy**: A car factory that produces different models based on customer orders.
   - **Use Case**: Creating objects without specifying the exact class of object that will be created.
   - [Learn More](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/factory-method)

3. **Abstract Factory Pattern**
   - **Analogy**: A furniture store that sells different styles of furniture (modern, classic) without revealing the details of how each piece is made.
   - **Use Case**: Creating families of related or dependent objects.
   - [Learn More](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/abstract-factory)

4. **Builder Pattern**
   - **Analogy**: A meal kit service that allows you to choose ingredients and customize your meal.

## üèóÔ∏è Structural Patterns

Structural patterns deal with object composition, creating relationships between objects to form larger structures. Think of these patterns as the architecture of a building, determining how different parts fit together.

1. **Adapter Pattern**
   - **Analogy**: A power adapter that allows you to plug in devices with different plug shapes.
   - **Use Case**: Allowing incompatible interfaces to work together.
   - [Learn More](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/adapter)

   - **Analogy**: A bridge that connects two islands, allowing for independent development on both sides.
   - **Use Case**: Separating an object‚Äôs interface from its implementation.
   - [Learn More](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/bridge)

3. **Composite Pattern**
   - **Analogy**: A company structure where employees can be treated as individuals or as part of a team.
   - **Use Case**: Composing objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies.

4. **Decorator Pattern**
   - **Analogy**: Adding toppings to a pizza without changing the base.
   - **Use Case**: Adding new functionality to an object dynamically.
   - [Learn More](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/decorator)

5. **Facade Pattern**
   - **Analogy**: A remote control that simplifies the operation of multiple devices.
   - **Use Case**: Providing a simplified interface to a complex subsystem.
   - [Learn More](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/facade)

6. **Flyweight Pattern**
   - **Analogy**: A shared pool of resources, like a library of books where multiple readers can access the same book.
   - **Use Case**: Reducing the cost of creating and manipulating a large number of similar objects.
 - [Learn More](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/flyweight)

7. **Proxy Pattern**
   - **Analogy**: A real estate agent who represents a homeowner to potential buyers.
   - **Use Case**: Providing a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access to it.
   - [Learn More](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/proxy)

## üß† Behavioral Patterns

Behavioral patterns deal with object interaction and responsibility, defining how objects communicate and collaborate. Think of these patterns as the rules of engagement in a team project.

1. **Chain of Responsibility Pattern**
   - **Analogy**: A customer service line where each representative can handle specific issues.
   - **Use Case**: Passing a request along a chain of handlers.
   - [Learn More](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/chain-of-responsibility)

2. **Command Pattern**
   - **Analogy**: A remote control that sends commands to various devices.
   - **Use Case**: Encapsulating a request as an object.
   - [Learn More](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/command)

3. **Interpreter Pattern**
   - **Analogy**: A translator who interprets languages for communication.
   - **Use Case**: Defining a representation for a language's grammar.
   - [Learn More](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/interpreter)

4. **Iterator Pattern**
   - **Analogy**: A librarian who helps you find books in a library without revealing the entire catalog.
   - **Use Case**: Accessing the elements of an aggregate object sequentially.
   - [Learn More](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/iterator)

5. **Mediator Pattern**
   - **Analogy**: A project manager who coordinates communication between team members.
   - **Use Case**: Encapsulating how a set of objects interact.
   - [Learn More](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/mediator)

6. **Memento Pattern**
   - **Analogy**: A time capsule that stores memories for future reference.
   - **Use Case**: Capturing and externalizing an object's internal state.
   - [Learn More](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/memento)

7. **Null Object Pattern**
   - **Analogy**: A placeholder in a recipe that indicates no ingredient is needed.
   - **Use Case**: Using a special object with neutral behavior to avoid null references.
   - [Learn More](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/null-object)

8. **Observer Pattern**
   - **Analogy**: A news subscription service that notifies subscribers of new articles.
   - **Use Case**: Defining a one-to-many dependency between objects.

9. **State Pattern**
   - **Analogy**: A traffic light that changes its behavior based on its current state (red, yellow, green).
   - **Use Case**: Allowing an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes.

10. **Strategy Pattern**
    - **Analogy**: A navigation app that offers different routes based on user preferences (fastest, shortest).

## üìè SOLID Principles

The SOLID principles are a set of design principles intended to make software designs more understandable, flexible, and maintainable. Think of these principles as the foundation of a well-constructed building.

1. **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**
   - **Analogy**: A chef who specializes in one type of cuisine.
   - **Use Case**: A class should have one reason to change.
   - [Learn More](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_responsibility_principle)

2. **Open/Closed Principle (OCP)**
   - ** Analogy**: A book that can be added to but not rewritten.
   - **Use Case**: Software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification.
   - [Learn More](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open%E2%80%93closed_principle)

3. **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)**
   - **Analogy**: A square can be considered a rectangle, but not all rectangles can be squares.
   - **Use Case**: Objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of a subclass without affecting correctness.
   - [Learn More](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liskov_substitution_principle)

4. **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)**
   - **Analogy**: A multi-tool that offers various functions but can be overwhelming if you only need a screwdriver.
   - **Use Case**: Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use.
   - [Learn More](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interface_segregation_principle)

5. **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)**
   - **Analogy**: A remote control that can operate various devices without being tied to a specific one.
   - **Use Case**: High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules; both should depend on abstractions.
   - [Learn More](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_inversion_principle)
